/**
 * The Series class is responsible for managing all operations related to TV series.
 *
 * It acts as the main logic class of the application by:
 * - Storing a list of SeriesModel objects in an ArrayList.
 * - Allowing users to capture new series details and save them into the list.
 * - Searching for series by their unique ID.
 * - Displaying series details in a clear format.
 * - Updating and deleting existing series records.
 * - Generating a full report of all series saved in the system.
 * - Exiting the application safely when requested.
 *
 * In short, this class provides all the functionality needed to add, update,
 * remove, and display series data, while working closely with the SeriesModel
 * class to store the actual information.
