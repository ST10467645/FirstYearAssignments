/**
 * The Question_1 class contains the main entry point of the program.
 *
 * This class handles all user interaction with the system by:
 * - Displaying the main menu and sub-menu options.
 * - Allowing the user to capture, search, update, delete, and display series details.
 * - Making calls to methods from the Series class to perform the actual logic.
 * - Continuously looping the menu until the user chooses to exit.
 *
 * The main purpose of this class is to provide a user-friendly interface
 * where the user can manage series data through a menu-driven application.
